Remember that if any models move, their whole unit counts as having moved for that turn, and this will prevent models with heavy weapons from firing even if those specific models stayed still. When shooting, heavy weapons always fire the number of times indicated regardless of range.

      <description>Instead of rolling to hit, simply place the template so that its narrow end is touching the base of the model firing it and the rest of the template covers as many models as possible in the target unit without touching any friendly models. Against vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the vehicle as possible without also touching a friendly model. Any models fully or partially under the template are hit. Against vehicles, use the direction of the firer to determine which armour facing is attacked. 


cover saves are ignored when resolving wounds, even by models inside area terrain! Wounds inflicted by template weapons do not have to be allocated on the models actually covered by the template, but can be put onto any model in the unit.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Blast" id="62f8-208c-dd69-303a" hidden="false">
      <description>When firing a blast weapon, models do not roll to hit, instead just pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the blast marker with its hole over the base of the target model, or its hull if it is a vehicle. You may not place the marker so that the base or hull of any of your own models is even grazed by it. Next, check if the shot has landed on target. If the hole at the centre of the marker is beyond the weapon’s maximum range, the shot is an automatic miss and the marker is removed. If the target is in range roll the scatter dice and 2D6 to see where the shot lands. If the scatter dice rolls a hit symbol the shot lands on target (ignore the 2D6). If an arrow is rolled, the marker is shifted in the direction shown by the arrow a number of inches equal to the total of the 2D6 minus the firing model’s BS (to a minimum of 0).


Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a scattering shot to land beyond the weapon’s range and line of sight. If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the table’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded. Once the final position of the blast marker has been determined, take a good look at the blast marker from above – all models whose bases are completely or partially covered by the blast marker are hit. 


Once the number of hits inflicted on the unit have been worked out, the firer rolls to wound as normal and then the controlling player may allocate these wounds on any model in the unit, not just the ones under the marker.</description>

    <rule name="Pinning" id="f884-0f3c-750b-50bb" hidden="false">
      <description>If a unit other than a vehicle suffers any unsaved wounds from a pinning weapon, it must immediately take a Pinning test. This is a normal Leadership test. If the unit fails the test, it is immediately forced to go to ground. As the unit has already taken its saves, going to ground does not protect it against the fire of the pinning weapon that caused the test (or indeed of any other weapon fired by the same unit that phase)


As long as the tests are passed, a unit may be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but if a unit has already gone to ground, no further Pinning tests are taken. 


If the special rules of a unit specify that the unit can never be pinned, the unit always automatically passes Pinning tests. Such units can still choose to go to ground voluntarily.</description>

    <rule name="Gets Hot!" id="2cd4-e1aa-f02f-7867" hidden="false">
      <description>Roll to hit as normal, except that you must roll to hit even if the target is found to be out of range. For each result of a 1 rolled on its to hit rolls, the firing model suffers a wound (normal saves apply). Because of their additional cooling systems, weapons on vehicles are not affected by this rule. 

Blast weapons do not roll to hit, so you must always roll a D6 before firing a Gets Hot! blast weapon to check if the weapon overheats. If you roll a 1, the weapon gets hot, it does not fire, and the firing model suffers a wound (normal saves apply). Otherwise the shot is resolved as normal.</description>

      <description>A set of twin-linked weapons count as a single weapon of that type, but to represent their fusillade of fire you may re-roll the dice to hit if you miss (including twinlinked blast weapons). In other words, twin-linked weapons don’t get more shots than normal ones, but you get a better chance of hitting with them.


Twin-linked template weapons are fired just like a single weapon, but they can re-roll the dice to wound. When fired against a vehicle, you may re-roll the armour penetration dice instead.</description>

    <rule name="Rending" id="6109-071e-11b4-47d1" hidden="false">
      <description>Any roll to wound of 6 with a rending weapon automatically causes a wound, regardless of the target’s Toughness, and counts as AP2. Against vehicles, an armour penetration roll of 6 allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total score.</description>

    <rule name="Sniper" id="1637-6707-7dd4-c55b" hidden="false">
      <description>Sniper hits wound on a roll of 4+, regardless of the victim’s Toughness. In addition, all sniper weapons are also rending and pinning weapons.


Against vehicles, sniper weapons count as Strength 3, which, combined with the rending rule, represents their chances of successfully hitting exposed crew, vision ports, fuel or ammo storage, etc.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Barrage" id="fdd0-aa5e-22a4-a18f" hidden="false">
      <description>All barrage weapons use blast markers and consequently use the rules for blast weapons, with the following exceptions:


• To determine if a unit wounded by a barrage weapon is allowed a cover save, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the marker, instead of from the firing model. Remember that models in area terrain get their cover save regardless of the direction the shot is coming from.


• Some barrage weapons have a minimum range as well as a maximum range (e.g. Range: 12&quot;- 48&quot;). If the centre of the marker is placed by the firer within the minimum range (before rolling for scatter), the shot misses automatically and is removed.


• Death raining from the sky is a truly terrifying experience, therefore all barrage weapons are pinning weapons as well (see Pinning).


• Barrage weapons can fire at a target they cannot see, but if they do this, the BS of the firer makes no difference and the blast marker scatters a full 2D6&quot; if an arrow is rolled on the scatter dice.


If a unit has more than one barrage weapon, they are all fired together in a salvo, as follows:


First place the blast marker for the weapon in the firing unit that is closest to the target. If the target is in range, roll for any scatter as described above. Once the first marker is placed, roll a scatter dice for each other barrage weapon fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is adjacent and touching the edge of the first marker placed (as shown in the diagram). If a hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the salvo that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if, through this process, some markers are placed overlapping one another. Once all of the markers are in place, work out the number of hits scored for each blast marker as usual for blast weapons and then roll to wound as normal.</description>

    <rule name="Fast" id="4d59-8511-a8e5-1f62" hidden="false">
      <description>Fast vehicles follow the normal rules for vehicles, with the additions and exceptions: 

Fast vehicles are capable of a third level of speed, called ‘flat out’. A fast vehicle going flat out moves more than 12&quot; and up to 18&quot;. This represents the fast vehicle moving at top speed, without firing its guns and is treated in all respects exactly the same as moving at cruising speed for a vehicle that is not fast (except where noted otherwise). For example, a fast vehicle moving flat out on a road may move up to 24&quot;.

Fast vehicles that move at combat speed may fire all of their weapons, just like other types of vehicles that have remained stationary (including ordnance barrage weapons, which cannot usually be fired on the move).

Fast vehicles that move at cruising speed may fire a single weapon (plus all defensive weapons, just like other types of vehicle moving at combat speed).

Fast vehicles moving flat out may fire no weapons.

Fast vehicles that moved ‘flat out’ in the previous turn and are not immobilised are hit on a 6 in assaults (exactly as if moving at cruising speed).

Passengers may not embark onto or disembark from a fast vehicle if it has moved (or is going to move) flat out in that Movement phase.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Skimmer" id="5768-8357-f0e3-1484" hidden="false">
      <description>Skimmers follow the normal rules for vehicles, with the additions and exceptions given below.


Unlike other vehicles, skimmers have transparent ‘flying bases’ under their hull. As normal for vehicles, distances are measured to and from the skimmer’s hull, with the exceptions of the vehicle’s weapons, access points and fire points, which all work as normal. The skimmer’s base is effectively ignored, except when assaulting a skimmer, in which case models may move into contact with the vehicle’s hull, its base or both.


Skimmers can move over friendly and enemy models, but they cannot end their move on top of either. Note that a skimmer must be set down on the table and left in place at the end of its move – it cannot be left hovering in mid-air!


Skimmers can move over all terrain, ignoring all penalties for difficult terrain and tests for dangerous terrain. However, if a moving skimmer starts or ends its move in difficult or dangerous terrain, it must take a dangerous terrain test. A skimmer can even end its move over impassable terrain if it is possible to actually place the model on top of it, but if it does so it must take a dangerous terrain test. 


A skimmer that is also fast and is moving flat out can move up to 24&quot;.


A skimmer that is not immobilised and has moved flat out in its last Movement phase counts as obscured (cover save of 4+) when fired at. 


A skimmer that is immobilised immediately crashes and is destroyed (wrecked) if it moved flat out in its last turn. If it moved slower, it suffers an immobilised result as normal.


If a skimmer is immobilised or wrecked, its base is removed, if possible. If this is not possible (the base might have been glued in place, for example), don’t worry about it. The skimmer’s anti-grav field is obviously still working and an immobilised skimmer will simply remain hovering in place, incapable of any further movement (including turning on the spot); a wrecked one is now a floating, burning wreck. Note that it is not permitted to remove the flying stand other than in the two cases above, as normally skimmers cannot land in battle conditions.


Skimmers may try to dodge out of the way of tanks attempting to ram them (as long as the ramming tank is not also a skimmer). The ramming tank stops in contact with the skimmer as normal, but then, if the player controlling the skimmer wants to dodge, he rolls a D6. On a 1 or 2 the collision proceeds as normal. On a 3+ the skimmer avoids the tank, neither vehicle suffers any damage, and the ramming tank stops in its tracks (literally!), its crew confused and disappointed.</description>

Whenever a damage roll is made against an opentopped vehicle, add +1 to the result.


Open-topped vehicles do not have specific fire points. Instead, all passengers in an open-topped vehicle may fire, measuring range and line of sight from the hull of the vehicle. Open-topped vehicles do not have specific access points. Models can embark or disembark within 2&quot; of any point of the vehicle.

    <rule name="Tank" id="3475-46b4-28e6-8fb0" hidden="false">
      <description>Tanks follow the normal rules for vehicles, with the additions and exceptions given below.


Tank shock: When moving a tank, the player can declare that the vehicle is going to attempt to make a tank shock attack instead of moving normally. This is an exception to the rule that enemy models cannot be moved through.


Remember, though, that friendly models still cannot be moved through, so a tank shock cannot be attempted if friendly models are in the way. Also, tank shock cannot be attempted against enemy units that are locked in combat.


To make this kind of attack, first turn the vehicle on the spot in the direction you intend to move it and declare how many inches the vehicle is going to move. The vehicle must move at least at combat speed. Note that because pivoting on the spot does not count as moving, this is not enough for a tank shock. 


Once the vehicle has been ‘aimed’ and the speed declared, move the vehicle straight forward until it comes into contact with an enemy unit or it reaches the distance declared – no other changes of direction are allowed during a tank shock. If no enemy unit is reached, just move the vehicle straight ahead for the distance declared and no special attack takes place. 


If an enemy unit other than another vehicle is reached (including any model in an artillery unit), the unit must take a Morale check and will immediately fall back if it fails it. If the test is passed the unit will simply let the tank move through, as if it was not there. Regardless of the result of the test, the vehicle keeps moving straight on, possibly tank shocking more enemy units until it reaches its final position. If the tank accidentally moves into contact with a friendly model or comes to within 1&quot; of an enemy vehicle, it immediately stops moving. 


If some enemy models in the enemy unit would end up underneath the vehicle when it reaches its final position (it makes no difference whether the unit is falling back or not), these models must be moved out of the way by the shortest distance, leaving at least 1&quot; between them and the vehicle and maintaining unit coherency.


If the tank moved slowly enough during the tank shock attack, it may fire as normal in the Shooting phase.


Death or Glory!: If a unit that has been attacked by tank shock passes its Morale test, one of its models in the vehicle’s path can stand and attempt to destroy it rather than move out of the way. The model nominated for this heroic duty makes a single attack against the incoming tank. Even if the weapon used is assault 3, for example, or the model is normally allowed more than one attack, only one attack is ever resolved in this case. The attack can be either a shot from a weapon carried by the model, or a single close combat attack using any weapon carried, including grenades. Whatever form it takes, the attack hits automatically, so resolve the hit against the vehicle’s front armour (using the front armour even if the model uses a close combat attack), and immediately apply any damage results. 


If the model successfully managed to stun, destroy or immobilise it, the vehicle grinds to a halt directly in front of the heroic individual (or blows up there!). 


If the attack fails to stop the vehicle, then the tank shock continues as normal, except that the brave (but perhaps rather foolish) glory seeker is crushed by the vehicle grinding over him – the model is removed, regardless of Wounds, saves (invulnerable or not), or any other clever way of staying alive they can think of.


Artillery units may attempt a Death or Glory! as well, with either a crewman (resolved as above) or a gun model. If a gun model does this and fails to stop the tank, both the gun and one crewman are removed.


Ramming: Ramming is a rather desperate manoeuvre and means that the tank must concentrate on moving at top speed towards one enemy vehicle. This means that it may not shoot in that turn’s Shooting phase, making it an attractive choice for vehicles that have no armament left, or are shaken.


Ramming is a special type of tank shock move and is executed the same way, except that the tank must always move at the highest speed it is capable of. Units other than vehicles in the way of a ramming tank are tank shocked as normal. However, if the ramming tank comes into contact with an enemy vehicle, the collision is resolved as follows.


Each vehicle immediately suffers a hit against the armour facing where the other vehicle has impacted (so the rammer always uses its front armour). The Strength of the hits will often be different for different vehicles, and is calculated as follows for each vehicle:


• Armour. Each point of armour above 10 on the point of impact: +1


• Speed. Each full 3&quot; moved that turn by the rammer before impact: +1


• Mass. If the vehicle is a tank: +1</description>

      <description>In the Movement phase, units subject to rage must always move as fast as possible towards the closest visible enemy. In the Shooting phase, they are free to decide whether to run, but if they do they must run towards the closest visible enemy. In the Assault phase they must always consolidate towards the closest visible enemy. Whilst falling back, embarked on a transport, or if no enemy is visible, they ignore this rule.</description>

    <rule name="Artillery" id="d466-164a-2f8e-6e4a" hidden="false">
      <description>Artillery units count as infantry in most respects, but when they are fired at, hits may be scored on the guns themselves, which have vehicle-like characteristics. 


The gun models are treated as vehicles with an Armour Rating of 10 Any glancing or penetrating hit will destroy a gun – do not roll on the Vehicle Damage table, the gun model is simply removed. If all the crewman models are killed, the guns are immediately removed as well. 


Sometimes the player has the choice of adding leadersor additional models to the crew of an artillery unit. These models are part of the crew in all respects and may operate the guns as normal, even if they are otherwise slightly different from the rest of the crew. Independent characters that join the unit, however, do not count as crew and cannot operate the guns.


Artillery units are slowed by difficult terrain like infantry, but gun models must also take dangerous terrain tests when they pass through it. There must be at least one crewman per gun to allow the unit to move – if there are fewer than this, then the unit may not move.


Unlike other vehicles (see next section), the gun models cannot fire if they moved at all in that turn’s Movement phase. Any crewman that is within 2&quot; of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it. The crewmen firing the guns may not fire any weapons they are carrying, while the other crew members (and any independent character that joined the unit) are free to fire their side arms, and can even shoot against a different unit than the one targeted by the unit’s guns. The guns themselves cannot split fire. When firing the guns, there must be a line of sight to the target from both the gun model and the crewman firing it (unless they are barrage weapons, of course). Ranges are measured from the gun model.


When firing against an artillery unit, roll for each hit inflicted: on a 1-4 a gun is hit, on a 5-6 a crewman is hit. Roll to wound the crewmen and to penetrate the guns’ armour separately. 


If an artillery unit goes to ground, this has no additional protective effect on the unit’s guns. Artillery units cannot run in the Shooting phase.


Artillery units may not launch assaults as long as they include any gun models.


If they are assaulted, move the assaulting models in base contact with the crew and guns as normal, but from then on the guns are ignored. All engaged enemies roll to hit and to wound against the crew (even if they are only engaged with guns). Engaged crew models can of course fight back, but the guns do not.


For the purposes of Morale and other Leadership tests, and for combat resolution, always ignore the gun models, as if they were not there. Because they need at least one crewman per gun in order for the unit to move, if an artillery unit does not have one crewman per gun when it is forced to fall back, the gun models without crewmen are abandoned and immediately removed. The rest of the unit then falls back as normal. If an artillery unit is forced to fall back from close combat and the enemy is free to make a sweeping advance, then the artillery unit automatically loses the Initiative roll and is caught and destroyed by the victor.</description>

      <description>Jump infantry can use their jump packs (or equivalent) and move up to 12&quot; in the Movement phase. This is optional and they can choose to move as normal infantry if they wish. When using jump packs, they can move over all other models and all terrain freely. However, if a moving jump infantry model begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a dangerous terrain test. Jump infantry models may not end their move on top of other models or impassable terrain, except that they can end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do that, however, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain. All jump infantry units may enter the battle by ‘deep strike’.


Jump infantry fall back 3D6&quot;, because they always use their jump packs when doing this. They move over any terrain and models when falling back, but if they end their move in difficult terrain (or on top of flat impassable terrain) they must still take a dangerous terrain test. They cannot end their move on top of other models, and must alter the direction of their fall back move as little as possible in order to avoid them, just as a normal unit would when falling back on foot. If they cannot do this, they are trapped and destroyed. 


Jump infantry assault 6&quot; like normal infantry. This move is slowed by difficult terrain in the same way as other infantry, because the unit always covers the last few yards of an assault on foot.</description>

    <rule name="Obscured Target" id="aea9-636a-767d-2636" hidden="false">
      <description>A vehicle is obscured if: 


• At least 50% of the facing of the vehicle that is being targeted (i.e. its front, side or rear) needs to be hidden by intervening terrain or models from the point of view of the firer for the vehicle to claim to be in cover. If this is the case, the vehicle is said to be obscured (or ‘hull down’). If a squad is firing at a vehicle, the vehicle is obscured only if it is 50% hidden from the majority of the firing models (do not count models that cannot hurt the vehicle). Just like with units of several models, if you’re not sure whether the vehicle is 50% in cover or not, simply modify its save by –1.


• Vehicles are not obscured simply for being inside area terrain. The 50% rule given above takes precedence.


• Obviously, vehicles cannot go to ground, voluntarily or otherwise


If the target is obscured and suffers a glancing or penetrating hit, it may take a cover save against it, exactly like a non-vehicle model would do against a wound (for example, a save of 5+ for a hedge, 4+ for a building, 3+ for a fortification, and so on). If the save is passed, the hit is discarded and no roll is made on the Vehicle Damage table.


If a special rule or a piece of wargear confers to a vehicle the ability of being obscured even if in the open, this is a 4+ cover save, unless specified otherwise in the Codex. 


It may rarely happen that the firing unit cannot see any part of the facing they are in (front, side or rear), but they can still see another facing of the target vehicle. In this case they may take the shot against the facing they can see, but to represent such an extremely angled shot, the vehicle receives a 3+ cover save.</description>

    <rule name="Jetbike" id="a523-0c5b-eb97-f0a0" hidden="false">
      <description>Jetbikes are the same as bikes, with the following exceptions: 


• In the Movement phase, jetbikes can move over all other models and all terrain freely. However, if a moving jetbike begins or ends its move in difficult terrain, it must take a dangerous terrain test. Jetbikes may not end their move over other models or impassable terrain, except that they can end their move on top of impassable terrain if it is actually possible to place the models on top of it. If they do that, however, they treat the impassable terrain as dangerous terrain. 


• In the Assault phase, jetbikes are treated like normal bikes when assaulting, as they must move close to the ground in order to fight.


• When falling back, jetbikes move over any terrain and models, but if they end their move in difficult terrain (or on top of flat impassable terrain) they must still take a dangerous terrain test. They cannot end their move on top of other models, and must alter the direction of their fall back move as little as possible in order to avoid them, just as a normal unit would when falling back on foot. If they cannot do this, they are trapped and immediately destroyed. 


All Eldar jetbikes (including Dark Eldar ones) are allowed to move 6&quot; in the Assault phase, even if they don’t assault. When Eldar jetbikes move in the Assault phase and do not assault, they treat difficult terrain in the same way as other jetbikes do in the Movement phase.</description>

    <rule name="Monstrous Creature" id="6b1b-944b-162c-6851" hidden="false">
      <description>All monstrous creatures have the ‘move through cover’ special rule. 


Instead of firing a single weapon, monstrous creatures can fire two of their weapons once per Shooting phase. They must, of course, fire both of them at the same enemy target. In addition, monstrous creatures have the ‘relentless’ special rule.


Unless otherwise specified in their special rules, monstrous creatures cannot go to ground, voluntarily or otherwise. In addition, for a monstrous creature to be in cover, at least 50% of its body has to be in cover from the point of view of the majority of the firing models. Also, standing in area terrain does not automatically confer a cover save to monstrous creatures – the 50% rule takes precedence. Cover for them works exactly as for vehicles. As usual, if you cannot clearly tell if 50% of the model’s body is covered, modify its cover save by –1.


All wounds inflicted in close combat by a monstrous creature ignore armour saves, just like those from a power weapon. In addition, monstrous creatures roll an additional D6 for armour penetration (2D6 + Strength) when attacking a vehicle in close combat.</description>

    <rule name="Walker" id="fea1-2c4a-c33c-5600" hidden="false">
      <description>While other vehicles can only move in the Movement phase, walkers can also run in the Shooting phase and assault in the Assault phase, just as infantry can.


Walkers move in exactly the same way as infantry, so they can move up to 6&quot; in the Movement phase and assault up to 6&quot; in the Assault phase.


Difficult terrain affects walkers just as it does infantry. Difficult terrain only counts as dangerous terrain for walkers if it would do so for infantry. If walkers fail a dangerous terrain test, they are immobilised. 


Unlike infantry, a walker has a facing, which influences where it can fire and its Armour Value when fired at.


Walkers can move and fire all of their weapons, just like a stationary vehicle.


Alternatively, they can choose to run like infantry, and this prevents them from firing and assaulting that turn, as normal (though they can still trigger their smoke launchers, if they have any). Obviously they cannot run if they are stunned or immobilised.


When firing a walker’s weapons, pivot the walker on the spot so that its guns are aimed at the target (assume that all weapons mounted on a walker can swivel 45º, like hull-mounted weapons) and then measure the range from the weapon itself and line of sight from the mounting point of the weapon and along its barrel, as normal for vehicles. This pivoting in the Shooting phase does not count as moving and represents the vastly superior agility of walkers in comparison with other vehicles. Keep in mind however that the walker will probably remain facing in this direction until its next Movement phase, so its facing will determine where its rear armour is going to be when the enemy returns fire! 


Walkers that are locked in combat cannot be shot at.


Walkers assault like infantry models, meaning that they make assault moves and can be locked in combat with enemy units. Walkers can make an assault even if they fired heavy or rapid fire weapons. However, like normal infantry, they can still only assault the unit they fired at.


In close combat, walkers fight like infantry models. However, any hits scored against them must roll for armour penetration and damage as for a vehicle. Models hitting a walker in close combat always roll for penetration against its front armour. 


Grenades and melta bombs can be used against a walker. A model will only manage to score a hit with a grenade against a walker on the roll of 6. However, if a walker is already stunned or immobilised at the start of the Assault phase, the attackers roll to hit based on the normal comparison of WS. Remember that models using grenades against vehicles only make one attack.


Immobilised and/or stunned walkers fight in close combat with one less attack than usual (to a minimum of 1), but otherwise attack normally, no matter how many immobilised and stunned results they suffered.


Shaken damage results do not affect the way a walker fights in close combat.


Each roll made on the Vehicle Damage table against a walker counts as a single wound for the purposes of working out who won the combat.


Defeated walkers do not take Morale checks and are not affected by the No Retreat! rule. 


Walkers make sweeping advances, pile-in moves and consolidations unless they are stunned or immobilised.


If a walker is rammed by a tank, it can choose to either brace itself for the impact, in which case the collision is resolved as normal for a vehicle, or it can attempt a ‘Death or Glory!’ attack in the same way as infantry (it cannot do this, however, if it is rammed in its rear arc). 


If it chooses ‘Death or Glory!’ and its attack fails to stop the ramming tank, the walker will not be ready for the impact and is hit on its rear armour in the collision.</description>

Bikes can move up to 12&quot; in the Movement phase. Bikes are not slowed down by difficult terrain. However, they treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain instead. 


Bikes also have the ‘Turbo-Boosters’ special rule.


As bikes are so fast moving, they fall back 3D6&quot;, rather than 2D6&quot;. Remember that they treat all difficult terrain as dangerous.

In that enemy Shooting phase, however, bikers lose the ability of going to ground, and automatically pass Pinning tests.

      <description>When a squadron moves, all of its vehicles move at the same speed (i.e. they all move at combat speed, at cruising speed, etc.). All of its vehicles have to maintain coherency, just like ordinary units, but vehicles in a squadron need only to remain within 4&quot; of each other to be in coherency, rather than within 2&quot;.


When shooting, a squadron of vehicles fires all of its available weaponry at a single enemy unit. Like other units, vehicles in squadrons can see and shoot through members of their own unit, just as if they were not there. This represents the vehicles manoeuvring around each other in a well-practiced battle formation.


When a squadron of vehicles is fired at, roll to hit and for armour penetration against the squadron’s common Armour Value (which is normally the same for all facings, and in most cases is 10). If the vehicles in the squadron have different Armour Values on different facings, use the Armour Value of the facing of the closest visible vehicle. 


Once all of the armour penetration rolls have been made, the player controlling the squadron allocates the glancing and penetrating hits to squadron members as he would allocate wounds to members of a normal unit. Then he takes any cover saves available to the squadron – use the rules for vehicles to determine if each squadron member is in cover (ignoring other members of the squadron, as if they were not there), and then the rules for normal units to work out if the entire squadron is in cover or not. After cover saves are taken, make the damage rolls for any remaining glancing and penetrating hits. The effects of damage results on vehicle squadrons are slightly different than on normal vehicles, as described below.


The mutual support of vehicles in squadrons makes them resilient to damage results affecting the crew. On the other hand, the crews are under strict orders to abandon immobilised vehicles and disable them, not to leave them as spoils of war for the enemy. To represent this, treat all immobilised results as destroyed (wrecked) and all stunned results as shaken. If a squadron consists of a single vehicle when an enemy unit fires at it, it reverts to the normal rules for vehicle damage results. 


For example, a squad of Space Marine Devastators opens fire against a squadron of three Eldar Vypers, scores several hits, and rolls for armour penetration against the squadron’s Armour Value of 10. This results in three penetrating hits and three glancing hits. The Eldar player allocates two penetrating hits on one Vyper, two glancing hits on another and one penetrating and one glancing hit on the last Vyper. He then takes the cover saves for his Vypers (4+, for example), saving one of the glancing hits and one of the penetrating hits. Finally the opponent rolls for damage for the two glancing and two penetrating hits that are left, and the results are immediately applied on the Vypers that suffered them. 


When engaged in close combat against a squadron, enemy models roll to hit and for armour penetration against the squadron as a whole. Damage results have the same effect as described above, and are allocated against the squadron at each Initiative value, in the same way as a normal combat. As usual for combats against vehicles, there is no defenders’ reaction, combat resolution, pile-in moves, consolidation, etc.</description>

      <description>See Structure Points, Super-Heavy Damage Table, Catastrophic Damage Table, Damage Control


Super-heavy vehicles behave on the battlefield like all other vehicles, with the exceptions below. The main difference is that they have Structure Points, which work similarly to Wounds.


Super-heavy vehicles can only move up to 6&quot; in the Movement phase, unless specified.


Super-heavy vehicles are affected by difficult and dangerous terrain like other vehicles, but can always re-roll a result of 1. In addition, if their second roll is another 1, they are not immobilised, but suffer a Drive Damaged result, as described in their damage table.


Super-Heavy vehicles may fire all of their weapons, regardless of how far they moved. Each weapon may be fired at a different target (each target must be within the weapon&apos;s fire arc).


Because super-heavy vehicles greatly vary in size, for the purposes of establishing line of sight from a Super-Heavy vehicle, always use real line of sight, working this out from the barrel of the weapon they are firing. The rules for area terrain apply as normal.


Just like Gargantuan creatures, Super-Heavy Vehicles are not affected by Psychic Powers (either friendly or enemy) with the exception of those that are attacks with a given Strength value, which affect them normally.</description>

    <rule name="Structure Points" id="80b4-4882-d52f-37b7" hidden="false">
      <description>Glancing and Penetrating hits have a chance of inflicting the loss of Structure points, and only by reducing their Structure Points to 0 can a Super-Heavy vehicle be destroyed.


Against Super-Heavy vehicles, enemies roll to hit and to penetrate armour exactly as with normal vehicles. If a glancing or penetrating hit is scored, the player must then roll a dice and consult the Super-heavy Damage Table. If a glancing hit is scored, subtract 2 from the dice score, and when a destroyer weapon scores a hit, add 1 to the dice score.


If a result reduces the target Super-Heavy vehicle to 0 Structure Points, it is destroyed - immediately roll one dice on the Catastrophic Damage table and apply the results.


It is a good idea to record the damage results suffered by each Super-Heavy vehicle on a sheet of paper, as these huge war engines can accumulate a great amount of secondary damage before finally being knocked out.</description>

    <rule name="Super-Heavy Walker" id="5769-fec8-be67-6310" hidden="false">
      <description>Instead of following the movement rules for Super-Heavy Vehicles, Super-Heavy Walkers move 12&quot;, exactly as if they were Gargantuan Creatures, except that their maximum movement may be reduced by Drive Damaged results, as normal for Super-Heavy Vehicle.


In the Assault phase, Super-Heavy Walkers once again follow the same rules as Gargantuan Creatures (including ignoring armour saves, extra armour penetration, dealing ordnance-level damage, stomp special attacks, the Terrifying special rule, etc)</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Super-Heavy Transport" id="4322-fa05-6af6-eb61" hidden="false">
      <description>These vehicles&apos; transport capacity is expressed as a number of models (thirty, for example) and friendly infantry models normally count as one (so the vehicle in the example could carry up to thirty infantry models). Larger friendly models will take up proportionally more space (Terminators count as two, a Dreadnought counts as ten models, for example).


Unless otherwise specified, each access point on a Super-Heavy Transport vehicle allows a separate unit to embark/disembark in a turn. If the vehicle is open-topped all transported units may disembark at once.


Transported models are forced to disembark from a Super-Heavy Transport only if the enemy reduces the vehicle to zero Structure Points. In any case, transported units must immediately perform and emergency disembarkation. Any units that may not disembark (not enough access points, for example), are destroyed.</description>

    <rule name="Super-Heavy Damage Table" id="7d0a-f9f5-cd24-3d70" hidden="false">
      <description>1 or less Gun Crew Shaken: One weapon (chosen by the attacker) cannot fire in the next turn. If all gun crews have been shaken, treat this result as a Driver Stunned.


2 Driver Stunned: Until the end of its next turn, the vehicle may not move, has its Attacks reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and may not use its Stomp special attack. If the driver is already stunned, treat this result as a Gun Crew Shaken.


3 Weapon Destroyed: One weapon (chosen by the attacker) cannot shoot for the rest of the game. If all weapons have been destroyed, treat this result as Drive Damaged.


4 Drive Damaged: The vehicle&apos;s maximum movement is permanently halved (normally to 3&quot;, but Walkers are reduced to 6&quot;, and Fast vehicles are reduced to either move 6&quot; and shoot or move 12&quot; and not shoot). If a second Drive Damaged result is suffered, the vehicle is Immobilised. An Immobilised Super-Heavy Walker has its Attacks reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and may not use its stomp special attack. If already Immobilised, treat this result as Weapon Destroyed.


5 Structural Damage: The vehicle loses 1 Structure Point.


6 Chain Reaction!: The vehicle loses 1 Structure Point and the enemy rolls again on this table (applying the same modifiers).


Note: if a vehicle suffers a Weapon Destroyed or Drive Damaged result, and is already Immobilised and has no weapons left, it suffers a Structural Damage result instead.</description>

    <rule name="Catastrophic Damage Table" id="f43f-4d1b-ef03-a76e" hidden="false">
      <description>1-3 Wrecked: The vehicle is destroyed. The model is left in place and will count as a wreck from then on.


4-5 Explosion: All models within 2D6&quot; suffer a wound on a 4+. Saves apply as normal. Vehicles are unaffected. The Super-Heavy Vehicle is removed from the table and replaced by a crater or area of rubble of appropriate size, if such a terrain piece is available.


6 Apocalyptic Explosion: All models within 3D6 suffer a Strength 9 AP2 hit! Vehicles within range are hit on their side armour. The Super-Heavy Vehicle is removed from the table, along with any removable terrain feature touched by the blast and replaced by a crater or area of rubble of appropriate size, if such a terrain piece is available.</description>

    <rule name="Damage Control" id="a7ff-0d45-cdb2-b3eb" hidden="false">
      <description>At the beginning of any of his turns, the controlling player may announce that a Super-Heavy Vehicle is diverting all resources to damage control. This means that the vehicle is doing absolutely nothing for the duration of the turn (no moving, shooting or assaulting). This cannot be attempted by a Super-Heavy Walker that is engaged in combat with another Super-Heavy Walker or a Gargantuan Creature.


In return, the player immediately rolls a dice for each Structure Point the vehicle has left. For each result of a 5+, the player can repair one weapon that suffered a Weapon Destroyed result or repair a Drive, cancelling the effect of the Drive Damaged result.


Note that this cannot be used to restore Void Shields, which are rolled for separately.</description>

    <rule name="Combat Squads" id="9b83-9c79-fe48-a8b5" hidden="false">
      <description>A number of ten-man units in the Space Marines army have the option of breaking down into two five-man units, called combat squads. The decision to split the unit into combat squads, as well as which models go into each combat squad, must be made when the unit is deployed. Both combat squads can be deployed in separate locations. The one exception to this is a unit that arrives by Drop Pod. The player can choose to split such a unit into combat squads when it disembarks from the Drop Pod.


If you decide to split the unit into combat squads, then each combat squad is treated as a separate unit for all game purposes from that point.</description>

    <rule name="Primary Weapon" id="fa44-d448-227b-6f6b" hidden="false">
      <description>Primary Weapons always count as Ordnance for the purposes of rolling for armour penetration and on vehicle damage charts.


In addition, whenever a primary weapon is affected by a Gun Crew Shaken or Weapon Destroyed result, the controlling player must roll a dice. On a result of 1-3 the primary weapon is shaken/destroyed as normal, but on a 4-6 the hit has no effect.</description>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Destroyer" id="7e16-5365-5905-4ad1" hidden="false">
      <description>A weapon with a Strength value of Destroyer is a Destroyer Weapon. If a Destroyer Weapon hits a vehicle (including partial hits using blast markers), there is no need to roll for armour penetration - it automatically scores a penetrating hit. 


This hit can be downgraded to a glancing hit by rules that have that effect, with the exception of cover, which cannot obscure the vehicle. 


In addition, when rolling on the appropriate vehicle damage chart, add +1 to the result. 


If a destroyer weapon hits a non-vehicle model, there is no need to roll to wound - it automatically scores a wound. If the target fails to save this wound (no cover saves are allowed, but Invulnerable saves do apply) the weapon always inflicts Instant Death, regardless of the target&apos;s Toughness. If the target is immune to Instant Death, then the Destroyer will cause one Wound as normal.</description>

      <characteristics>
        <characteristic name="Description" typeId="e24a-6018-20cf-d76c">Psykers can use one psychic power per player turn. To use a psychic power successfully the psyker must pass a Psychic test, which is a normal Leadership test. Note that this test must always be made on the psyker’s own Leadership value. Even where Leadership tests would normally be taken on the value of another model, tests for using psychic powers are always taken using the psyker’s own Leadership.


If the result of a Psychic test is either a double 1 or double 6 this indicates that something horrible has happened to the psyker.  The psyker suffers 1 wound with no armour or cover saves allowed. Invulnerable saves are allowed, but the power of the Warp is so great that successful saves must be re-rolled. Note that a psyker who rolls double 1 will still use his power, even if he is wounded or killed as a result. 


Psychic powers that take the form of shooting attacks are very common. Using a psychic shooting attack counts as firing a ranged weapon (an assault weapon, unless specified otherwise). So, for example, the psyker must be able to see his target unit, cannot be locked in combat, or must not have run in the Shooting phase if he wishes to use a psychic shooting attack. In the same way, if a psyker targets a unit with a psychic shooting attack, then he can only assault that unit in the ensuing Assault phase. Even if a psyker has a special rule allowing him to use more than one psychic power per turn, he can use only one psychic shooting attack (as models can fire only one ranged weapon per turn). However, if he is allowed to fire more than one ranged weapon per turn, he can replace the firing of any of the weapons he is allowed to fire with a psychic
shooting attack (but still cannot use the same power twice in a turn).</characteristic>

      <characteristics>
        <characteristic name="Description" typeId="e24a-6018-20cf-d76c">If you wish to use this ‘deep strike’ option, then the units in question must begin the game in reserve (even if you are playing a special mission where the ‘reserves’ special rule is not being used). Roll for arrival of these units as specified in the rules for reserves and then deploy them as follows.


First place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position you would like the unit to arrive, and roll the scatter dice. If you roll a hit the model stays where it is, but if an arrow is shown this determines the direction the model is scattered in. If a scatter occurs, roll 2D6 to see how many inches the model moves away from the intended position. 


Once this is done, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the original model in a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further circle should be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle should include as many models as will fit. 


Models arriving via deep strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.


In the Movement phase when they arrive, these units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a deep striking transport vehicle. Units deep striking into ruined buildings are placed on the ground floor. They may not deep strike directly inside a transport vehicle or a building, which will count as impassable terrain as normal.


In that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can fire (or run) as normal, and obviously count as having moved in the previous Movement phase. Vehicles count as having moved at cruising speed. 


In that turn’s Assault phase, however, these units may not launch an assault (even if they have the ‘fleet’ special rule), unless clearly stated in their special rules – they are too disrupted by their deep strike move. 


Note that some units always have the option to deep strike, while others may only arrive in this way in missions where the deep strike special rule is used.


If any of the models in a deep striking unit cannot be deployed because they would land off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top or within 1&quot; of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the deep strike Mishap table and apply the results.</characteristic>

If both sides have scouts, the players roll-off and the winner decides who goes first, and then alternate moving these units. 


If a unit with this ability is deployed inside a dedicated transport vehicle, it confers the scout ability to the transport too.

If the test is passed, the unit breaks from combat and immediately moves up to 3D6&quot; in a straight line in any direction, ignoring the units they are locked with. No sweeping advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat may consolidate. A hit &amp; run move is not slowed by difficult terrain, but is affected by dangerous terrain.

        <characteristic name="Description" typeId="e24a-6018-20cf-d76c">Fast vehicles follow the normal rules for vehicles, with the additions and exceptions: 


Fast vehicles are capable of a third level of speed, called ‘flat out’. A fast vehicle going flat out moves more than 12&quot; and up to 18&quot;. This represents the fast vehicle moving at top speed, without firing its guns and is treated in all respects exactly the same as moving at cruising speed for a vehicle that is not fast (except where noted otherwise). For example, a fast vehicle moving flat out on a road may move up to 24&quot;.


Fast vehicles that move at combat speed may fire all of their weapons, just like other types of vehicles that have remained stationary (including ordnance barrage weapons, which cannot usually be fired on the move).


Fast vehicles that move at cruising speed may fire a single weapon (plus all defensive weapons, just like other types of vehicle moving at combat speed).


Fast vehicles moving flat out may fire no weapons.


Fast vehicles that moved ‘flat out’ in the previous turn and are not immobilised are hit on a 6 in assaults (exactly as if moving at cruising speed).


Passengers may not embark onto or disembark from a fast vehicle if it has moved (or is going to move) flat out in that Movement phase.</characteristic>

Place some cotton wool or other suitable marker on or around the vehicle to show it is obscured. The vehicle may not fire any of its weapons in the same turn as it used its smoke launchers, but will count as obscured in the next enemy Shooting phase, receiving a 4+ cover save. 


After the enemy’s Shooting phase, the smoke disperses with no further effect. Note that a vehicle may still use smoke launchers even if its crew are shaken or stunned.


It is worth pointing out that some armies might use different versions of smoke launchers, which have slightly different rules. As normal, the rules in the Codex take precedence.</characteristic>

5-6 - You! You&apos;re a Traitor!: Randomly select one model in the target unit from among those with the highest Leadership. That model suffers a single Strength 3 hit for every other model in the target unit. Cover saves cannot be taken against these hits, and they can never be allocated to another model.

        <rule name="Walker" id="db50-c27e-da40-605c" hidden="false">
          <description>While other vehicles can only move in the Movement phase, walkers can also run in the Shooting phase and assault in the Assault phase, just as infantry can. 


Walkers move in exactly the same way as infantry, so they can move up to 6&quot; in the Movement phase and assault up to 6&quot; in the Assault phase.


Difficult terrain affects walkers just as it does infantry. Difficult terrain only counts as dangerous terrain for walkers if it would do so for infantry. If walkers fail a dangerous terrain test, they are immobilised. 


Unlike infantry, a walker has a facing, which influences where it can fire (see below) and its Armour Value when fired at.


Walkers can move and fire all of their weapons, just like a stationary vehicle. 


Alternatively, they can choose to run like infantry, and this prevents them from firing and assaulting that turn, as normal (though they can still trigger their smoke launchers, if they have any). Obviously they cannot run if they are stunned or immobilised.


When firing a walker’s weapons, pivot the walker on the spot so that its guns are aimed at the target (assume that all weapons mounted on a walker can swivel 45º, like hull-mounted weapons) and then measure the range from the weapon itself and line of sight from the mounting point of the weapon and along its barrel, as normal for vehicles. This pivoting in the Shooting phase does not count as moving and represents the vastly superior agility of walkers in comparison with other vehicles. Keep in mind however that the walker will probably remain facing in this direction until its next Movement phase, so its facing will determine where its rear armour is going to be when the enemy returns fire!


Walkers that are locked in combat cannot be shot at.


Walkers assault like infantry models, meaning that they make assault moves and can be locked in combat with enemy units. Walkers can make an assault even if they fired heavy or rapid fire weapons. However, like normal infantry, they can still only assault the unit they fired at.


In close combat, walkers fight like infantry models. However, any hits scored against them must roll for armour penetration and damage as for a vehicle. Models hitting a walker in close combat always roll for penetration against its front armour. This is because the walker is not a static target like other vehicles and rampages through the melee, turning to face its enemies. Consequently a walker is quite capable of tearing apart its foe in close combat, while only the specially armed (or monstrously powerful) will have any hope of destroying a walker up close.


Grenades and melta bombs can be used against a walker. A model will only manage to score a hit with a grenade against a walker on the roll of 6. However, if a walker is already stunned or immobilised at the start of the Assault phase, the attackers roll to hit based on the normal comparison of WS. Remember that models using grenades against vehicles only make one attack.


Immobilised and/or stunned walkers fight in close combat with one less attack than usual (to a minimum of 1), but otherwise attack normally, no matter how many immobilised and stunned results they suffered. 


Shaken damage results do not affect the way a walker fights in close combat.


Each roll made on the Vehicle Damage table against a walker counts as a single wound for the purposes of working out who won the combat.


Defeated walkers do not take Morale checks and are not affected by the No Retreat! rule.


Walkers make sweeping advances, pile-in moves and consolidations unless they are stunned or immobilised.</description>

        <rule name="Walker" id="7a8b-4e69-7d80-8be4" hidden="false">
          <description>While other vehicles can only move in the Movement phase, walkers can also run in the Shooting phase and assault in the Assault phase, just as infantry can. 


Walkers move in exactly the same way as infantry, so they can move up to 6&quot; in the Movement phase and assault up to 6&quot; in the Assault phase.


Difficult terrain affects walkers just as it does infantry. Difficult terrain only counts as dangerous terrain for walkers if it would do so for infantry. If walkers fail a dangerous terrain test, they are immobilised. 


Unlike infantry, a walker has a facing, which influences where it can fire (see below) and its Armour Value when fired at.


Walkers can move and fire all of their weapons, just like a stationary vehicle. 


Alternatively, they can choose to run like infantry, and this prevents them from firing and assaulting that turn, as normal (though they can still trigger their smoke launchers, if they have any). Obviously they cannot run if they are stunned or immobilised.


When firing a walker’s weapons, pivot the walker on the spot so that its guns are aimed at the target (assume that all weapons mounted on a walker can swivel 45º, like hull-mounted weapons) and then measure the range from the weapon itself and line of sight from the mounting point of the weapon and along its barrel, as normal for vehicles. This pivoting in the Shooting phase does not count as moving and represents the vastly superior agility of walkers in comparison with other vehicles. Keep in mind however that the walker will probably remain facing in this direction until its next Movement phase, so its facing will determine where its rear armour is going to be when the enemy returns fire!


Walkers that are locked in combat cannot be shot at.


Walkers assault like infantry models, meaning that they make assault moves and can be locked in combat with enemy units. Walkers can make an assault even if they fired heavy or rapid fire weapons. However, like normal infantry, they can still only assault the unit they fired at.


In close combat, walkers fight like infantry models. However, any hits scored against them must roll for armour penetration and damage as for a vehicle. Models hitting a walker in close combat always roll for penetration against its front armour. This is because the walker is not a static target like other vehicles and rampages through the melee, turning to face its enemies. Consequently a walker is quite capable of tearing apart its foe in close combat, while only the specially armed (or monstrously powerful) will have any hope of destroying a walker up close.


Grenades and melta bombs can be used against a walker. A model will only manage to score a hit with a grenade against a walker on the roll of 6. However, if a walker is already stunned or immobilised at the start of the Assault phase, the attackers roll to hit based on the normal comparison of WS. Remember that models using grenades against vehicles only make one attack.


Immobilised and/or stunned walkers fight in close combat with one less attack than usual (to a minimum of 1), but otherwise attack normally, no matter how many immobilised and stunned results they suffered. 


Shaken damage results do not affect the way a walker fights in close combat.


Each roll made on the Vehicle Damage table against a walker counts as a single wound for the purposes of working out who won the combat.


Defeated walkers do not take Morale checks and are not affected by the No Retreat! rule.


Walkers make sweeping advances, pile-in moves and consolidations unless they are stunned or immobilised.</description>
